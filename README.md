To run our program on the Khoury server, enter "make" and run "./main" on the command line. The program will begin by asking if you want to create a new project or load an existing project. If you're running it for the first time, enter "1" to create a new project. The program will ask for the name of the project and automatically assign the current user as the owner of the project. Otherwise, enter "2" to load an existing project from the "project.txt" file. The "project.txt" file is used for data persistence of issues, sprints, projects, and users. Whenever the user exits the program, the project will automatically be saved into "project.txt" for future use which allows for data retainment.
